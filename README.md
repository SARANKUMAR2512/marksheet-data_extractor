# marksheet-data_extractor

>>>***Validating and entering the marks for a single person is really a time consuming and hectic process. 
>>>There is also a high possibility of registering incorrect or missing data. 
>>>Moreover, retrieving the data physically also requires lot of time and effort.***


>>  First step is to install the respective packages of python libraries and for feature detection we are giving  the marksheet template.
>>  We will use feature detection to align the images, detect the features and match them.
>>  Next, by using the input marksheet ,we are going to align it with original template. so that it becomes as the original image.
>>  We have extracted the image using pixel dimensions.
>>  Using pixel dimensions we have cropped the marksheet into pieces of images based on roi information.
>>  Finally, we extracted all the information in the form of text and appending it to the right title and atlast saved in Excel sheet.
